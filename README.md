## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is a **dynamic retail sales dashboard** built using **Looker Studio**.  
The Retail Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of business performance across multiple retail categories. The dashboard tracks four key performance indicators (KPIs):
1. Total Revenue ($454K) â€” representing the overall sales performance, showing the businessâ€™s total income.
2. Units Sold (2,510) â€” highlighting total product sales volume across all categories.
3. Average Order Value ($455.38) â€” measuring the average revenue generated per transaction.
4. Top Selling Category (Electronics) â€” identifying the product category that contributes most to total revenue.

Several analytical views are included to uncover insights from sales data. The Cumulative Sales chart visualizes monthly revenue and quantity trends, indicating consistent performance peaks around May. The Average Revenue by Day bar chart reveals weekday purchasing patterns, with the highest revenue typically occurring on Saturdays. The Product Category Analysis (by revenue and quantity) shows a balanced contribution among Clothing, Electronics, and Beauty products, with Clothing as the best category by revenue generated and quantity sold. while the Age Segmentation analysis indicates that customers aged 45â€“54 are the most active buyers. A Gender-based Box Plot provides insight into purchase value distribution between male and female customers.

The dashboard also features a Performance Target Gauge, showing that the company achieved 90.9% of its $500K revenue goal, and a Monthly Summary Table detailing customer count, quantity, and average order value per month.

Overall, this dashboard delivers actionable insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance, supporting data-driven decision-making for retail strategy and marketing optimization.
